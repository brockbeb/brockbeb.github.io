        <h3>Hello!</h3>
        <p>
          I'm Brock. I'm an application analyst based in Overland Park, KS.
          Working at
          <a href="https://www.kansashealthsystem.com">TUKHS</a> by day and a
          freelance developer at night.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've always been interested in learning computer science and have
          finally taken the plunge. I'm really excited about programming and the
          ability to imagine anything or solve a problem building it from
          scratch, using thoughtful, intuitive, and delightful interactions. My
          main areas of interest lie in web development and data science.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a certificate of completion from
          <a
            href="https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0"
            >Harvard's CS50</a
          >, which provides a great foundation in computer science and
          programming fundamentals. In this class I wrote in a number of
          languages, including C, Python, SQL, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML,
          demonstrating concepts around abstraction, algorithms, data
          structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software
          engineering, and web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am currently taking
          <a
            href="https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-web-programming-python-and-javascript?delta=1"
            >Harvard's CS50W</a
          >, which takes a deeper dive into web development. Looking closer at
          design and implementation of web apps built on frameworks like Django,
          React, and Bootstrap. Building projects that work with APIs,
          interactive UIs, and cloud services like Git and Heroku.
